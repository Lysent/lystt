stat manager
	contains an array of named numeric stats with a maximum and minimum.
	stats can be `get`, `set`, and `mutate`d by numeric values. non-numeric values cause no change to occur.
	all operations on a stat return its value after the operation.
	stats are automatically constrained within their bounds without errors or warnings.
	the manager uses an index object to accelerate lookups at the cost of memory.

	`get` returns an object of shape {value, min, max}.
	`getValue` return the numeric value of the stat.
	`getStatsArray` returns the raw stats array.

free entity physical properties
	contains an x and y position and velocity, as well as a rotation (in grad). there is a circular size parameter for physical interactions.
	the rotation is automatically rectified to [0, 400) when modified.
	the size is a radius.
	the [x, y, z] is stored as an array, so is the velocity [vx, vy, vz]. 

tile entity physical properties
	similar to the free entity properties, but the rotation is orthogonal and the size is square.
	the rotation is still in grad but is automatically snapped to the nearest {0, 100, 200, 300} and rectified when modified.
